Recently I have watched a Japanese TV show あなたの番です (Your Turn To Kill). It is characterized by an exchange murder game (交換殺人). 13 residents in 
an apartment complex joined the exchange murder game, writing down the person who he/she wants to kill in a sheet, and draw others' sheet in random.
The resident will murder who he/she draws. A serial murder happens then.  

(insert a picture here)

The TV show is too interesting for me to mention some bugs. In an episode, a resident, Miss Kuroshima (黒島ちゃん) pointed out that this game may be a failure because
someone may draw their own sheet. In other words, it is possible that at least one person cannot actually participate in this game by killing someone else's target.

This is obviously a mathematical problem, so I think I can write a program to calculate the successful possibility, that is, everyone draws others' sheets.
